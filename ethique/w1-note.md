# Leçon 1: Aristote et l'éthique des vertus
- L'éthique n'est que des approximations. That's all you need to know about ethics, really.
- Interesting stuff about different schools of "Bien" prior to Aristotle's, will add later.
- Would save me so much time reading about how modern proponents of Stoicism often point out about how Epictetus is all about maximizing pleasure, which is not exactly what he proposed.
