# Obedience, conformity, and deindividuation
- Watched the stanley milgram's classic documentary. 
> This is, perhaps, the most fundamental lesson of our study: ordinary people, simply doing their jobs, and without any particular hostility on their part, can become agents in a terribly destructive process."

- stanley milgram.
- marriage experiment: people who are recruited off the street are asked to repeat the marriage vows after the registrar. Real funny.
- The bottom line is that given a situation, people can divorce from their usual sense of ethics and do not only bad but also atrocious things.
## Group pressue and social conformity
- conformity is when you give in to a group.
- you can't know the degree to which you'll give in when the majority does. It's hard, even if you identify as a nonconformist. Be kind.
- collectivist vs individualist culture
- minority can have an influence but they need to be consistent.
## The dark side of deindividuation
- deindividuation occurs when
> indiduals are not seen or paid attention to as individuals. The members do not feel that they stand out as individuals... [and there is] a reduction of inner restraints against doing various things.

- What are "various" things?
	- positive: uninhibited dancing, singing, performing
	- negative: lynchings, gang rapes, riots, stealing, cheating (how's that last part related to deindividuation directly?)
- Conditions that might increase the chances that deindividuation occurs:
	- anonymity
	- diffused responsibility
	- group size and group activity
	- physical and mental arousal
	- altered time perspective
	- sensory input overload
	- physical involvement
	- altered states of consciousness.
- a meta-analysis on 60 studies on deindividuation concluded that
> larger groups either induce or facilitate stronger antinormative behavior.

	- deindividuation doesn't discriminate gender
	- degrees of deindividuation correlates with size of the group.
