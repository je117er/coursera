## Bystander intervention in emergencies
- the more bystanders there are, the less likely they are to help someone in trouble. If there's only a bystander, then they're gonna help, the reasoning is that the only person who could help the troubled person is the former.
- Nobody wants to go against a group (of bystanders) or looks foolish by doing the wrong thing.
- If you're in a trouble, pick out a person and ask them to help you.
- If a person stepped forward then the dynamics would change.
- Most studies have been done in North America and Europe. But cases of bystander effect have been observed in Asia.
- Does there exist personality types that are likely to help? No apparently
> Anybody can be led either to help or not to help in a specific situation. Characteristics of the immediate situation may have a more important influence on what the bystander does than [the individual's] personality or life history. These findings further suggest that motivational deficiences may not account for the unresponsive bystander.

- Bibb LatanÃ© and John Darley
## Aggression, violence, and terrorism
- Aggression is "physical or verbal behavior intended to cause harm."
	- hostile aggresion springs from anger or hostility.
	- instrumental aggression also aims to harm, but mainly as a means to some other end. Eg: the us bombing iraq to overthrow saddam hussein.
- Does watching violent TV shows correlate with children becoming violent? I think not? Apparently according to the best available evidence, watching violence on TV does make children become more aggressive. What a mind fuck. I used to think that it didn't.
> Over 1000 studies... point overwhelmingly to a causal connection betweeen media violence and aggressive behavior."

- On the flip side, serial TV dramas may take advantage of people's tendency to imitate to promote social change.
- Oh God, a study shows that the rate of murder changed more if a boxing match received more publicity.
- Of course other forms of media (video games, social media, etc) could cause an increase in violence (*coughs pornography*, which is causally linked to sexual aggression).
> Experimental research shows that exposure to nonviolent or violent pornography results in increases in both supporting sexual aggression and in actual aggression.

Why nonviolent as well though?
### Some questions to consider
- If you enjoy violent video games and feel that they haven't made you more aggressive or desensitized you to violence, how do you know that you haven't been affected?
- Suppose you aren't affected when you play violent video games, but research suggests that other people are - how would you answer a critic who says that you are contributing to a general culture of violence by making it normative to shoot at other people for fun?
- Regardless of whether you play video games, what do you think about the U.S. military developing a game that might promote aggression or desensitize teenagers to violence?
- What are the most effective steps you can take to reduce the effects of media violence in your life, in your family, and in society?
- Also note that there's still debate about this issue.
### Other triggers of aggression
- biological factors (e.g., genetics, testosterone)
- alcohol use
- exposure to violent words and images.
- cultural factors (e.g., living in a country that emphasizes male honor and machismo)
- physical pain or discomfort (e.g., crowding, air pollution, heat)
### Moral story
- Beware of situational factors.
- Choose what you should do. Chose nonviolent media.
## Psychology of terrorism
- Terrorism is "premediated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents, usually intended to influence an audience.
### Some key terms
- "Arab" is an ethnic label that refers to a cultural group united by history and the Arabic language.
	- millions of christian arabs
	- thousands of jewish arabs.
- "the arab world" includes twenty-some countries in the middle east and northern africa.
- Muslims believe in Islam. The population of muslims is around 1.8B.
> The outstanding common characteristic of terrorists is their normality

- Martha Crenshaw, professor emerita of government.
- Suicide bombers are not more likely to be...
	- religious
	- unemployed
	- fatherless
	- friendless
- National Research Council Conclusion:
> There is no single or typical mentality - much less a specific pathology - of terrorists. However, terrorists apparently find significant gratification in the expression of generalized rage

### Were the 9/11 terrorists madmen?
- a mentally unbalanced terrorist would present a security risk to other terrorists in the group, because terrorists need to operate in secrecy.
- consequently, terrorist groups generally look for reliable team players and try to screen out unstable individuals.o
### Possible causes of terrorism
- ~~Political repression~~
	- relatively little terorism occurs under dictatorships (easy to crush using a national military)
- ~~Poverty~~
	- least developed countries don't have much terrorism
- ~~Lack of education~~
	- Palestinian suicide bombers have lower rates of poverty and higher rates of formal education than other Palestinians, and the 9/11 terrorists came from middle-class or upper middle-class backgrounds.
- Apparently, there's no general cause of terrorism:
> The endeavor to find a *'general theory'* theory of terrorism, one overall explanation of its roots, is a futile and misguided enterprise. The motives of the Russian revolutionaries of 1881 have as much to do with al Qua'ida and the various jihads as does the terrorism of Oklahoma City with Peru's Shining Path or the Colombian revolutionaries and drug dealers.

- However, there's a general pattern to terrorism directed at a specific country or population, e.g., a common cause of anti-american terrorism is U.S. military, financial, and political support for unpopular regimes. In many cases, terrorists are trying to:
	- drive the us out of a geographic area or end its support for a regime.
	- retaliate in response to U.S. policies and actions.
	- restore a sense of honor, status, or control.
- The overwhelming majority of terrorists are angry young men (less than 30 years old).
### If war isn't the answer, what is?
- in the long run, education and socialization to make the next generation realize that other groups aren't enemies and violence is not the solution.
### Resolving social dilemmas
- regulation.
- small is beautiful: create smaller groups so people would be more obliged to take responsiblity
- communication.
- changing the payoffs.
- appeals to altruistic norms.
### Perceived injustice
- Conflict is a *perceived* incompatibility of actions or goals. Many conflicts contain but a small core of truly incompatible goals; the bigger problem is the misperceptions of the other's motives and goals.
- The seeds of misperception: *Self-serving bias* leading individuals and groups to accept credit for their good deeds and shirk responsibility for bad deeds, without according others the same benefit of the doubt. A tendency to *self-justify* inclines people to deny the wrong of their evil acts ("You call that hitting? I hardly touched him!"). Thanks to the *fundamental attribution error*, each side sees the other's hostility as reflecting an evil disposition. One then filters the information and interprets it to fit one's *preconceptions*. Groups frequently *polarize* these self-serving, self-justifying, biasing tendencies. One symptom of *groupthink* is the tendency to perceive one's own group as moral and strong, the opposition as evil and weak. Acts of terrorism that in most people's eyes are despicable brutality are seen by others as "holy war". Indeed, the mere fact of being in a group triggers an *ingroup bias*. And negative *stereotypes* of the outgroup, once formed, are often resistant to contradictory evidence.
- People see justice as equity - the distribution of rewards in proportion to individuals' contributions. If you and I have a relationship, it's equitable if the ratio of my outcomes to my inputs is equal to the ratio of your outcomes to your inputs.
- How do those who are exploited react?
	- accept and justify their inferior position
	- demand compensation, i.e. harassing, embarassing, or cheating the exploiter.
	- retaliating, if all else fails.
- When in conflict, don't assume the other fails to share your values and morality. Rather, compare perceptions, assuming the other is likely perceiving the situation differently.
