## Bystander intervention in emergencies
- the more bystanders there are, the less likely they are to help someone in trouble. If there's only a bystander, then they're gonna help, the reasoning is that the only person who could help the troubled person is the former.
- Nobody wants to go against a group (of bystanders) or looks foolish by doing the wrong thing.
- If you're in a trouble, pick out a person and ask them to help you.
- If a person stepped forward then the dynamics would change.
- Most studies have been done in North America and Europe. But cases of bystander effect have been observed in Asia.
- Does there exist personality types that are likely to help? No apparently
> Anybody can be led either to help or not to help in a specific situation. Characteristics of the immediate situation may have a more important influence on what the bystander does than [the individual's] personality or life history. These findings further suggest that motivational deficiences may not account for the unresponsive bystander.

## Aggression, violence, and terrorism
- Aggression is "physical or verbal behavior intended to cause harm."
	- hostile aggresion springs from anger or hostility.
	- instrumental aggression also aims to harm, but mainly as a means to some other end. Eg: the us bombing iraq to overthrow saddam hussein.
- Does watching violent TV shows correlate with children becoming violent? I think not? Apparently according to the best available evidence, watching violence on TV does make children become more aggressive. What a mind fuck. I used to think that it didn't.
> Over 1000 studies... point overwhelmingly to a causal connection betweeen media violence and aggressive behavior."

- On the flip side, serial TV dramas may take advantage of people's tendency to imitate to promote social change.
- Oh God, a study shows that the rate of murder changed more if a boxing match received more publicity.
- Of course other forms of media (video games, social media, etc) could cause an increase in violence (*coughs pornography*, which is causally linked to sexual aggression).
> Experimental research shows that exposure to nonviolent or violent pornography results in increases in both supporting sexual aggression and in actual aggression.

Why nonviolent as well though?
### Some questions to consider
- If you enjoy violent video games and feel that they haven't made you more aggressive or desensitized you to violence, how do you know that you haven't been affected?
- Suppose you aren't affected when you play violent video games, but research suggests that other people are - how would you answer a critic who says that you are contributing to a general culture of violence by making it normative to shoot at other people for fun?
- Regardless of whether you play video games, what do you think about the U.S. military developing a game that might promote aggression or desensitize teenagers to violence?
- What are the most effective steps you can take to reduce the effects of media violence in your life, in your family, and in society?
- Also note that there's still debate about this issue.
### Other triggers of aggression
- biological factors (e.g., genetics, testosterone)
- alcohol use
- exposure to violent words and images.
- cultural factors (e.g., living in a country that emphasizes male honor and machismo)
- physical pain or discomfort (e.g., crowding, air pollution, heat)
### Moral story
- Beware of situational factors.
- Choose what you should do. Chose nonviolent media.
