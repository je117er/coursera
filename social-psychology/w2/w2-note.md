# How we see ourselves and others
## Attribution Theory
- Why should you care about how people explain their behavior? Because the attribution will determine how they'll deal with the consequences of their behavior.
### Harold Kelley's attributional framework
* People usually explain behavior in terms of:
	* Person => inside
	* Entitle => outside influences
	* Time => this particular occasion that causes that
* Causal attributions are based on:
	* Consensus => do other people respond the same?
	* Distinctiveness => do other situations evoke the same behavior?
	* Consistency => Does the same thing happen time after time?
#### Example of causal attribution
* You're the only person who performed well on a variety of tests over a range of occasions.
* How is this attributed?
	* Low consensus: nobody but you has aced those tests
	* Low distinctiveness: you didn't underperform in any test
	* High consistency: occurs over a range of occasions.
* Kelly predicts a "person" attribution.
### Salience and causal attribution
- Salience is a stimulus that grabs your attention right away.
- In general, the more salient a stimulus is, the more likely it is to be viewed as causal (causing behavior to happen)
- Perceptions of causality are partly a function of where one's attention is directed.
- And attention is in turn a function of salience.
- **Eg**: in an interrogation simulation, video focusing on the suspect makes observers think they're guilty, neutral when focusing on both, and the interrogator being pushing for a false confession when focusing on the latter (video focus = salience) => New Zealand adopted a national policty to videotape interrogation focusing on both the suspect and interrogator to reduce false negative rates.
## Some twists and turns when explaining behavior
- People tend to ignore **consensus** in explaining behavior.
- **False uniqueness effect**: we think we're more ethical/have more desirable behavior than others. 
### Fundamental attribution error
- Tendency to underestimate situational factors, and overestimate dispositional (personal) factors in controlling behavior.
- Is a true **error**, not simply a bias.
- Seems more common in the West than in the East when situational factors are obvious.
#### Actor-observer differences in attribution
> FAE concerns trait inferences from behavior (attributing a trait to a person, given a behavior). whereas the actor-observer asymmetry concerns explanations of behavior(attributing a behavior to its causes.
> Suppose a colleague tutors a student who got behind his class work and one infers that this colleague is generous, helpful, perhaps idealistic (a trait inference). One may not ask why this colleague is helping the student (a causal attribution) because the action does not appear puzzling. If there's something puzzling about the act (because, for example, the colleage had declared on her syllabus that she would not provide extra tutoring), one's trait inferences would not be particular suitable explanations for why this colleague broke her own rule and helped the student; one would instead look for her motives, her reasons to do so.

- Not the same as the fundemental attribution error.
- In social psych, an actor is someone who takes action.
- Actors are more likely to explain their behavior as a function of situation factors than are observers, mainly when the behavior/outcome is negative, and vice versa.
- The actor-observer difference is a bias.
- How is salience related here? (the role of salience in attribution is **still** debated)
	- To actors, the situation is often most salient.
	- To observers, the actor tends to be more salient.
## Is the attidue bone connected to the behavior bone?
- Context: La Pierre's study: a chinese couple visited 251 establishments (restaurants, cafes, etc) with a psychologist in the time when the US was enacting the chinese exclusion policy. Only one among 251 encounters was there observed racial discrimination toward the chinese couple. Furthermore, they were received with "more than ordinary consideration" on 72 occasions. Later surveyed of the same establishments and establishments close to them revealed that most of them wouldn't accept the chinese couple.
- Limitations (good god):
	 - la piere's ratings of discrimination of course weren't indepedent ones.
	 - the chinese couple might have encountered more discrimination if lapiere hadn't been with them.
	 - there's only one couple used in the study.
- Another context: 47 seminary students (who're trained to become priests/ministers) were asked to give a speech about either:
	- Jobs at which seminary students would be effective.
	- The parable of the Good Samatarian (the story of people helping others in need)
and will encounter a man in need on the way to the speech location
- Independent variables:
	1. the topic of the speech
	2. How much of a hurry the students were in: high-hurry, intermediate hurry, low hurry.
- Main findings:
	1. Sutdents in a hurry were much less likely to offer help than students not in a hurry.
	2. Giving a speech on the parable of the Good Samatarian didn't significantly affect the amount of help offered.
- Question: Is it common for everyday behaviors and attitudes to be inconsistent?
- Answer: yes, possible explanations:
	- journals rejecting reports of consistency because they're boring and obvious.
	- many attitudes relate to any one behavior.
	- many behaviors related to any one attitude.
	- attitude items tend to be more general (attitude about chinese vs. behavior toward the chinese couple.)
	- attitudes and behaviors are measured under different conditions (the former often in surveys, for instance.)
### Attitude-behavior consistency when
- They closely match each other (e.g., in generality/specificity): chinese people!!
- The attitude is strong or potent (e.g., acquired through experience)
- The attitude is easy to recall and has been stable over time.
- People are made aware of themselves and their attitudes.
- Outside influences are kept to a minimum.
