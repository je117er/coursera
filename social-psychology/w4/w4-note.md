## Group dynamics
- Group dynamics: psychological processes and behaviors that occur either:
	- within a group (intragroup dynamics), or
	- between groups (intergroup dynamics)
- groupthink: decision making suffers when a cohesive group becomes insulated from dissenting viewpoints, esp when the group leaders promote a particular solution or course of action.
- production blocking: a group member talking and others being blocked from talking or developing their own ideas.
- social loafing: tendency for people to exert less effort when they pool their efforts toward a common goal than when they're individually accountable.
- free riders: people who benefit from the group but give little in return.
- group polarization: group-produced enhancement of members' pre-existing tendencies; a strengthening of the members' average tendency, not a split within the group.
#### Symptoms of groupthink
- an illusion of invulnerability
- unquestioned belief in the group's morality.
- rationalization
- stereotyped view of opponent
- conformity pressure
- self-censorship
- illusion of unanimity.
- mindguards.
#### Janis's recommendations for preventing groupthink
- be impartial - don't endorse any position.
- encourage critical evaluation; assign a "devil's advocate". Welcome the input of a genuine dissenter if possible.
- occasionally subdivide the group, the reunite to air differences.
- welcome critiques from outside experts and associates.
- before implementing, call a "second-chance" meeting to air any lingering doubts.
### Individual vs. group problem solving
- groups typicall outperform individuals when solving difficult problems: working groups, committees, panels, boards, task forces, juries.
### Abilene paradox
- when groups of people take actions in contradiction to what they, as individuals, really want and end up defeating the purposes they set out to achieve.
- it's about people managing agreements goes south.
- could happen to couples as well, imagine a married couple who each neither loves or likes the other, but none is brave enough to break up.
#### Causes
- action anxiety, aka procrastination which mixes with
- negative fantasies, bad things'd happen if we took action
- fear of separation.
- confusion of reality and fantasy: look, sometimes your anxiety blows up 
- scapegoating to assign responsibility suggests that a conflict is the problem here, when in fact we're all in an uninanimous agreement.
#### Solutions
- do assessments of real risks and risks when you don't take action
- own up to your beliefs, and don't attribute that to others'.
- confront the group, on what you all agree on.
## Prejudice, stereotyping, and intergroup biases
- Categorical thinking is discrete, socially construct??? Where to draw the line?
- A person could be:
	- Genetically male.
	- Anatomically female.
	- Hormonally male
	- Behaviorally male
- Is it possible for somebody to be genetically and hormonally different? What the hell is male behavior? This lecture is really unhelpful.
- 1 in 100 white people has black ancestors, fair enough.
- 75 to 90% of black people have white ancestors, also fair.
- What the hell, what model parents, damn:
> No matter what was written in the Bible or any historical document, I can't believe in a God who would not love my Noah [a transsexual boy] for exactly the way he is

- Biology loves differences, society doesn't, which is true.
- Gender and sex are not the same, ffs.
- Wtf "homosexuality is exclusively a human construct" What the hell is the course headed to? Animals kill, too, so should humans?
## The minimal group: from dots to discrimination in 60 seconds
### Ingroups and out groups
- focusing on groups often:
	- changes how we see the individuals or elements within the groups
	- leads us to see one group as better or worse than another.
- ingroup bias: tendency to favor one's own group or see it as superior to an outgroup.
> many forms of discrimination and bias may develop not because outgroups are hated, but because positive emotions such as admiration, sympathy, and trust are reserved for the ingroup and withheld from outgroups.

- the results of minimal group research don't mean that prejudice and discrimination are merely a matter of superficial group dynamics. prejudice is also a function of culture, politics, history, and economics.
- there's technique to avoid ingroup bias?
### Intergroup biases don't feel like biases.
- the outgroup homogeneity bias: a tendency to see outgroup members as more alike than ingroup members.
- reducing members of an outgroup to a single identity is just one step away from stereotyping them.
- the effect is strongest when:
	- the ingroup is relatively large
	- the ingroup and outgroup are enduring, real-life groups, not artificial ones created in a lab.
- if the ingroup is small and the attibutes in question are important to its identity or stereotypically associated with the group, the effect may disappear or even reverse.
- benovelent sexism:
> some forms of sexism are, for the perpetrator, subjectively benevolent, characterizing women as pure creatures who ought to be protected, supported, and adored... This idealization of women simultaneously implies that they are weak and best suited for conventional gender roles; being put on a pedestal is confining, yet the man who places a woman there is likely to interpret this as cherishing, rather than restricting, her (and many women may agree.)

- discrimination and bias often have less to do with attitudes towarrd the outgroup than with ingroup favoritism - that is, preferring the ingroup over the outgroup.
