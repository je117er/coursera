## Group dynamics
- Group dynamics: psychological processes and behaviors that occur either:
	- within a group (intragroup dynamics), or
	- between groups (intergroup dynamics)
- groupthink: decision making suffers when a cohesive group becomes insulated from dissenting viewpoints, esp when the group leaders promote a particular solution or course of action.
- production blocking: a group member talking and others being blocked from talking or developing their own ideas.
- social loafing: tendency for people to exert less effort when they pool their efforts toward a common goal than when they're individually accountable.
- free riders: people who benefit from the group but give little in return.
- group polarization: group-produced enhancement of members' pre-existing tendencies; a strengthening of the members' average tendency, not a split within the group.
#### Symptoms of groupthink
- an illusion of invulnerability
- unquestioned belief in the group's morality.
- rationalization
- stereotyped view of opponent
- conformity pressure
- self-censorship
- illusion of unanimity.
- mindguards.
#### Janis's recommendations for preventing groupthink
- be impartial - don't endorse any position.
- encourage critical evaluation; assign a "devil's advocate". Welcome the input of a genuine dissenter if possible.
- occasionally subdivide the group, the reunite to air differences.
- welcome critiques from outside experts and associates.
- before implementing, call a "second-chance" meeting to air any lingering doubts.
### Individual vs. group problem solving
- groups typicall outperform individuals when solving difficult problems: working groups, committees, panels, boards, task forces, juries.
### Abilene paradox
- when groups of people take actions in contradiction to what they, as individuals, really want and end up defeating the purposes they set out to achieve.
- it's about people managing agreements goes south.
- could happen to couples as well, imagine a married couple who each neither loves or likes the other, but none is brave enough to break up.
#### Causes
- action anxiety, aka procrastination which mixes with
- negative fantasies, bad things'd happen if we took action
- fear of separation.
- confusion of reality and fantasy: look, sometimes your anxiety blows up 
- scapegoating to assign responsibility suggests that a conflict is the problem here, when in fact we're all in an uninanimous agreement.
#### Solutions
- do assessments of real risks and risks when you don't take action
- own up to your beliefs, and don't attribute that to others'.
- confront the group, on what you all agree on.
## Prejudice, stereotyping, and intergroup biases
- Categorical thinking is discrete, socially construct??? Where to draw the line?
- A person could be:
	- Genetically male.
	- Anatomically female.
	- Hormonally male
	- Behaviorally male
- Is it possible for somebody to be genetically and hormonally different? What the hell is male behavior? This lecture is really unhelpful.
- 1 in 100 white people has black ancestors, fair enough.
- 75 to 90% of black people have white ancestors, also fair.
- What the hell, what model parents, damn:
> No matter what was written in the Bible or any historical document, I can't believe in a God who would not love my Noah [a transsexual boy] for exactly the way he is

- Biology loves differences, society doesn't, which is true.
- Gender and sex are not the same, ffs.
- Wtf "homosexuality is exclusively a human construct" What the hell is the course headed to? Animals kill, too, so should humans?
