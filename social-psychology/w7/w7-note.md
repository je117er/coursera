## tips on leading a happy life
### two general types of empathy:
	- affective empathy: feeling the emotions that someone else feels - what's sometimes known as "emotional matching"
		- if you feel happy and i empathize, i feel happy.
		- if you feel upset, i feel upset, too.
	- cognitive empathy: imagining how someone else thinks or feels or imagining what you would think or feel when you're in that person's situation.
- empathy scores predicted child abuse even better than life stress. omg.
### Some correlates of empathy
- people high in empathy not only tend to be less prejudiced and aggressive, but they and their life partners report higher levels of relationship satisfaction.
- people high in empathy are more likely to intervene in emergency situations.
- people high in cognitive empathy tend to reach better negotiated outcomes.
## Happiness
- Money does cause happiness. Married people are happier than single people on average. Nah, go hell with your children.
- Feelings change over time. The brain has the tendency to think that what we feel now won't change in the future.
- Hedonic adaptation: people get unintested in new things easily, so they start seeking for more novelty.
- A corollary of hedonic adaptation: when you can't change one aspect of your life, instead of continuing resenting it, you start from tolerating to liking it, eventually.
- Social relationship is one of the things that make us happy. Happiness can spread like wildfire in the social network.
- Turns out people think exercising makes them the most happy and watching TV the least.
- Social bond is important, living in a cold climate might make you happier than living by a sandy beach.
- People who give are happier than those who are less inclined to give.
- "If you think money doesn't buy happiness, you're probably not spending it right."
### Intimacy
- Frienship/relationship has a close relationship with proximity, in other words, how close you are to each other. That's the thing people like each other have in common.
- Also, similarity:
	- age and education level.
	- race and ethnicity
	- personality and attitudes.
	- economic status.
	- physical characteristics.
- "Opposites attract" isn't backed by research.
- Physical attractiveness, when first dating, might be more important than other attributes, like personality.
- Actually it's men who fall in love faster and are slower to end a relationship, not women.
#### What makes a relationship successful
- Again, similarity.
- One negative thing has to be made up by five positive things.
- Shit, you just can't overgeneralize what'll make a relationship works, because it varies over many different situations.
