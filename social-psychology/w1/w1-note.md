- Social psychology is the scientific study of how people think, influence, and relate to one another. Some possible questions:
	- How to have a happy life?
	- How do relationships work?
	- How can we reduce inequity, inequality, violence, and climate change?
- Example: "Research shows that physically attractive people are more/less intelligent than physicall unattractive people. True or false?" For each of the option (more/less), most people chose "True".
=>  **Hindsight bias** = I knew-it-all-along effect
=> If you don't know what is coming, you can't tell what it will be. Sort of like unknown unknowns. It's easy to think that something's predictable the second you know that it's happened.
### Do we share the same reality
sadly our perceptions are influenced by:
* what we're paying attention to
* contextual factors, which differ for each person
* past exp
* expectations
* motivations
* etc

### Confirmation bias
- seeking information confirming your prior beliefs, conceptions and existing theories. stop collecting information once you think you have enough evidence to prove your theory.
- goes hand in hand with movivated reasoning.
### Self-fulfilling prophecies
- there's expectations to be fulfilled.
- **behavioral confirmation**: when a social expectation brings about the expected behavior.
### Thin slices: Social judgments in the blink of an eye
- a meta-analysis of thin-slice research showed that judgments about people's personality, competency, veracity, and levele of depression were just as accurate if not more so when the judgments were based on thin slices of behavior less than 5 mins in length.
- dear god. moral story is learn how to make good impressions.
### possible explanations
1. evolutionary value:
	* potential threats
	* potential partners
	* competent leaders
2. brains may be faster at processing emotions than cognitions.
3. thin slices may avoid distractions coming at later time and reducing accuracy
### summary:
- social judgments can be lighteningly accurate, especially when taken rapidly.
- meanwhile, people tend to have their opinions become riddled with biases and once judgments/beliefs are formed, they could be hard to be changed.
