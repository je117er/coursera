- Social psychology is the scientific study of how people think, influence, and relate to one another. Some possible questions:
	- How to have a happy life?
	- How do relationships work?
	- How can we reduce inequity, inequality, violence, and climate change?
- Example: "Research shows that physically attractive people are more/less intelligent than physicall unattractive people. True or false?" For each of the option (more/less), most people chose "True".
=>  **Hindsight bias** = I knew-it-all-along effect
=> If you don't know what is coming, you can't tell what it will be. Sort of like unknown unknowns. It's easy to think that something's predictable the second you know that it's happened.
