# Reflective Listening/Rapport
* Goals
	- make contact
	- provide first introduction
	- establish rapport
	- use specific active reflective listening techniques such as paraphrasing to establish some degree of empathy (perceived understanding, sympathy is feeling what the other's feeling.)
* RL is an ongoing processed used throughout the entire interaction with a person who's in crisis.
## Importance of RL
- RL's effectiveness comes from being able to demonstrate that the person in distress is understood:
* You trust when you feel understood.
* And when you trust, you will be compliant with the responder's request for help.
- Used in: counseling, crisis intervention, parent-child communications, sales, hostage negotiations.
## Beginning the conversation:
* Establish rapport as quickly as possible is essential
* Observe and listen
* What you say will highly depend upon the situation, but generally:
	1. Introduce yourself in a respectful manner.
	2. Explain what you're doing
	3. Ask an initial question
## Reflective listening tools: Questions
* When you ask well phrased questions, a person in distress can feel a sense of value and participation in the solution of their problem, instead of telling them do this and do that.
	* Skillfully asked questions can also convey a sense of *support*.

=> it shows you care, you're interested in their needs, their problems: "you're valuable, and i want to help you. let me know how i can i help you effectively"
> There's nothing so powerful as the well phrased question."
### Types of questions
* Closed-ended questions
	* "Yes"
	* "No"
	* good for quickly identifying facts

* Open-ended questions
	* "What?"
	* "Why?"
	* "How?"
	* good for filling in details and probing for further information
- The problem with the question "You doing okay?" is that even when people don't feel ok, they'd answer "yeah" anyway because they're uncomfortable with asking for assistance. Ask "how you going"/"what's going on" instead
### Key to RL = Summary paraphrase
- Taking someone else's words and rephrasing the core content into your words:
	* "Sounds to me like..."
	* "So, in other words..."
	* "What you're saying is..."
	* "What I'm hearing you say is..."
and sending it back as affirmation or modification.
- Don't abuse the above terms.
> The deepest craving of human nature is to feel appreciated
- It's not about the solution per se, but maybe sometimes a word, a presence of somebody.
## How it works: Imagine yourself to be a mirror
- Once engaged, a person in distress sends (non)verbal messages about their current state of distress.
- As a human "mirror", you reflect back the person's emotional state and/or the most salient content within his or her messages.
- Simply speaking, the core of reflective listening consists of taking the other person's words, paraphrasing the essence of their message into your words, then reflecting back.
- You decide to reflect the emotional/objective aspect of their messages first:
	* start with the emotion that seems the most important first
- As Aristotle said, "the road to logos and the rational mind is paved through pathos" (pathos is emotion.)
## Simulation:
### Which response is reflective?
* All caps: "I've been told I can't live in my house anymore after the flood. something about mold. i just don't understand. the house is solid as a rock!"
	- my response after i've learned this: "these things can really be confusing: you sound pretty angry now"
		- captures both content and emotion
		- validates both aspects of the person's comment
	- my usual response: "what have you done so far to get an explanation?"
		- this open-ended questoin is good at gather more information but misses the psychological context of frustration or anger
	- other responses:
		- "let's find someone to explain all this": offered to solve the problem right away but doesn't address the emotion.
		- "have you spokene with someone from the health department?": close-ended question, again doesn't address the emotional content.
* All caps: "I lost my home in the fire. i lost a lot of things of value to me - not just financial value but personal value."
	- my response after i've learned rl: "sounds like this fire was devastating on so many levels."
	- my usual response: "you should contact your insurance company asap"
		- damn for assuming the house is insured. dammit.
		- doesn't address any personal impact issues.
	- other response: 
		- "have you contacted your insurance company yet?": closed-ended, tries to fix the problem, makes an assumption, ignores personal impact, elicits information but not reflective
 		- "How are you coping with all of these losses?": open-ended question recognizing the "human" aspect of the disaster, implies concern for the person, but not *reflective*
* All caps: "when the flood waters came it washed my car away, but it didn't even touch my neighbor's car... i don't get it. why me?"
	- my response from now on: "I'm so sorry; it really doesn't seem fair, does it"
		- reflective, shows empathy
		- open for more discussion
	- my usual response: "have you thought about how you are gonna get around?"
		- no touch on emotional content
		- closed ended.
		- not reflective
	- other responses:
		- "you know, sometimes bad things just happen": not reflective, no emotional support, bad all around
		- "how do you think something like that happened?": not reflective, no emotional support, only focuses on the objective aspect but ignores the emotional impact of unfairness
## Mechanisms
* A willingness to listen
* Rapport, alignment (avoids provocative arguments)	
* Value in what the other person has to say, not rush in and say you know best since maybe you're missing not so obvious key information in order to provide the right solution (not that you should come up with a solution right away anyway)
* A desire to assist in problem solving.
* Provides a sense of interpersonal support (the single best predictor of human resilience)
* Empathy (attempting to identify how the other person feels) => trust => compliance
### Paraphrases
- best inserted into the conversation when the person in distress has expressed a complete thought or emotion... and then pauses
### Remember context
* Be present: If you have to say "i'm listening", your attention has been elsewhere.
* listen
* allow catharsis: let people vent
* don't rush to solve a complicated problem with a simplistic solution, unless the resoluton seems evident (use your common sense!)
* don't try to make the person feel better by diminishing, trivializing their concerns: "is that it/all?"
* don't argue (gosh. now don't conflate this kind of "argue" with the other type, tho")
* have a conversation, not just showing the techniques.
