# Introduction to Psychological First Aid
## Definition
* PFA is a *compassionate* and *supportive* presence designed to mitigate **acute** distress and assess the need for continued mental health care. 
* Note that PFA doesn't replace actual diagnoses and therapy.
## PFA Objectives:
* Be able to discuss PFA key concepts.
* Listen reflectively.
* Differentiate benign psychological/behavioral crisis reactions from more severe crisis reactions.
* Prioritize (triage) psychological/behavioral crisis reactions: Which needs intervention now? Which can await?
* Reduce acute distress and dysfunction, if possible.
* Recognize when to direct the person in distress to further (mental) health support.
* Practice self-care (physically, mentally, etc), because caring for others is hard on yourselves.
## Terms and Concepts
- The need for psychological services are on the rise as disasters and conflict continue to surge

> ... in hours after a disaster, at least 25% of the population maybe stunned and dazed, apathetic and wandering - especially if impact has been sudden and totally devastating... At this point, psychological first aid and triage... are necessary

=> Need for increased surge capacity, which is the ability to provide services for the surge in demand
- PFA is a subset of psychological crisis intervention. Research suggests that PCI is better than therapy afterward (assuming no PCI was performed), or as Benjamin Franklin said:
> An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
Although it must be noted that PCI, in this case, is in no way analogical to prevention.
### RAPID PFA model:
1. Rapport and reflective listening:
2. Assessment: who's in distress and needs assistance right now?
3. Prioritization: who should we help first?
4. Intervention: what can I do now to help?
5. Disposition and follow-up: how effective were our strategies? how are they doing?
