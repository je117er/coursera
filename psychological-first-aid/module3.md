# Assessment of needs
- The intervention is guided by the needs of the person in that moment and their specific situation.
## After contact, introduction and rapport is achieved
- Next step is to **assess** basic physical and psychological status/needs.
- This rudimentary assessment is derived from a guided conversation involving the survivor's own narrative.
- Punctuated with specific questions regarding details of the event and specific reactions to the event.
- These components of the story can be thought as the "context" for intervention
## Conversational assessment questions
- Intervention is largely dependent on the needs of the person in distress.
	+ You must **listen** to the story
- The story consists of the person's reactions to the event refined by some rudimentary disclosure of the event itself
	- Find out the survivor's current physical and psychological status; identify how the person is doing - their personal reactions to the event.
	- To refine understanding, put the survivor's status in an event-based context; identify what happened
- Ask specific questions when necessary to clarify ambiguous aspects of personal reactions and/or aspects of the event itself.
### Eustress vs. distress vs. dysfunction groups
1. Eustress: doing well.
	- "What is it that you need doing today? Can you do it?"
	- no action needed, just need to observe and be available.
2. Dysfunction: have severe, incapacitating impairement preventing them from getting the things they need to get done done
	- help as you're needed and in an appropriate way.
3. Distress: benign, mild
	- monitor them.
- Remeber that with the distress group, their distress will lessen over time. Also called natural resilience, so this group needs no active intervention.

## Simulation
- Inquires about Gina's physical well-being first.
- Infers what Gina means by unfairness.
- Uses the open question "How are you feeling about all of this right now?" to see what issues are most on Gina's mind at this moment.
- Upon identifying some depression, seeks to clarify its nature and listens for vegatative signs indicative of more severe depression.
- Don't get defensive, be observant but don't jump to premature conclusions.
