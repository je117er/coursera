# How to untangle an argument
## How to identify an argument
### Argument markers
- Conclusion markers: so, therefore, thus, accordingly. After these words is a conclusion.
- Reason markers: because, for, as, for the reason, and the reason why. After these words is a reason for the conclusion.
- Context will decide if a word is an argument marker.
- If you don't know if it's a argument marker, try replacing the word with another argument marker to see if the sentence's meaning's still the same.
- "If" doesn't count as an argument marker.
### Standard form
- To put worded arguments in a form that's easy to analyze.
- Standard form:
	- (1) Premise
	- (2) Premise
	_______________________
	(three dots) conclusion (from 1 and 2)
## A problem for arguments
- Simple rule of thumb: You shouldn't believe the conclusion if you don't think the premises are true.
- But if you require justification for every premise, the problem quickly becomes skeptical regress (the chain of needing to prove premises never ceases.)
- Solutions to skeptical regress:
	- give an unjustified premise.
	- use circular arguments
	- use an infinite chain of arguments.
		- example: there is life on mars <= there's at least one bacterium one mars <= there's at least two bacteria on mars <= so and and so forth.
- Tricks for dealing with the skeptical regress in everyday life
	- assure the audience, by appealing to authority.
	- discount objection
	- guard your claim by saying "probably", for example.
