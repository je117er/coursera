# How to untangle an argument
## How to identify an argument
### Argument markers
- Conclusion markers: so, therefore, thus, accordingly. After these words is a conclusion.
- Reason markers: because, for, as, for the reason, and the reason why. After these words is a reason for the conclusion.
- Context will decide if a word is an argument marker.
- If you don't know if it's a argument marker, try replacing the word with another argument marker to see if the sentence's meaning's still the same.
- "If" doesn't count as an argument marker.
### Standard form
- To put worded arguments in a form that's easy to analyze.
- Standard form:
	- (1) Premise
	- (2) Premise
	_______________________
	(three dots) conclusion (from 1 and 2)
