## The nature of argument
### Why arguments matter
- You want to have justified beliefs and reasons. Good arguments are a priori to good reasons.
- Learning objectives:
	* Analyze arguments.
	* Evaluate deductive arguments.
	* Evaluate inductive arguments.
	* Avoid fallacies.
### What is an argument
- Argument is not fighting. What you mean is a verbal fight, a yelling match, not an argument.
- Argument is not abuse, a personal attack.
An **argument** is:
- a series of sentences, statements, or propositions
- where some are premises
- and one is the conclusion
- where the premises are intended to give a reason for the conclusion
### What are arguments used for
- **persuasion**
- **justifying**: showing someone a reason to believe, but not necessary to convince them.
Difference between the two lies in your purposes to give the arguments
- makes other people more understanding of your points, if persuasion is not the goal.
- **explanation**: give a reason why something happened/is true. Note that if an event didn't happen, there's nothing to be explained about.
Turn the above into questions:
1. Are they trying to change my mind? Persuasion.
2. Are they trying to justify the reason for something? Justification.
#### Aristotle's classification of explanations:
1. **Causal**: Why is the Earth round? Sphere's the most optimal structure.
2. **Teleological** (goal-related): Why are you self-isolating at home? To avoid contracting coronavirus.
3. **Formal**: why doesn't this jigsaw puzzle fit into the picture? look at the shape.
4. **Material**: why are metals cold? 'cause they lose heat fast.
An event can be explained by any of explanation above.
#### An explanation in the form of an argument:
General laws/principles + initial conditions => conclusion
### Strong arguments don't always persuade everyone
- But you succeeded in justifying the reason anyway.
- Don't try to persuade **everybody**.
