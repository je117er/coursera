## The nature of argument
### Why arguments matter
- You want to have justified beliefs and reasons. Good arguments are a priori to good reasons.
- Learning objectives:
	* Analyze arguments.
	* Evaluate deductive arguments.
	* Evaluate inductive arguments.
	* Avoid fallacies.
### What is an argument
- Argument is not fighting. What you mean is a verbal fight, a yelling match, not an argument.
- Argument is not abuse, a personal attack.
An **argument** is:
- a series of sentences, statements, or propositions
- where some are premises
- and one is the conclusion
- where the premises are intended to give a reason for the conclusion
### What are arguments used for
- **persuasion**
- **justifying**: showing someone a reason to believe, but not necessary to convince them.
Difference between the two lies in your purposes to give the arguments
- makes other people more understanding of your points, if persuasion is not the goal.
- **explanation**: give a reason why something happened/is true. Note that if an event didn't happen, there's nothing to be explained about.
Turn the above into questions:
1. Are they trying to change my mind? Persuasion.
2. Are they trying to justify the reason for something? Justification.
#### Aristotle's classification of explanations:
1. **Causal**: Why is the Earth round? Sphere's the most optimal structure.
2. **Teleological** (goal-related): Why are you self-isolating at home? To avoid contracting coronavirus.
3. **Formal**: why doesn't this jigsaw puzzle fit into the picture? look at the shape.
4. **Material**: why are metals cold? 'cause they lose heat fast.
An event can be explained by any of explanation above.
#### An explanation in the form of an argument:
General laws/principles + initial conditions => conclusion
### Strong arguments don't always persuade everyone
- But you succeeded in justifying the reason anyway.
- Don't try to persuade **everybody**.
### Arguments are made of language
1. Language is impportant
2. Language is conventional:
3. Language is representational: Language can't change the facts of the world. is it?
4. Language is social
#### Rules in language that are important to arguments
- (Linguistic) meanings: its use in normal situations.
- Referrential/descriptive language don't cover abstract concepts.
- Referrence is not the same as meaning. Two words can refer to the same thing and mean different things.
1. A speech act occurs even if the intended effect doesn't occur.
2. A linguistic act is a the utterance of a meaningful sentence.
3. A conversational act is when you want an effect to happen.
### Levels of language
#### Linguistic acts
- Follow grammar and syntax is enough. There has to be words in it.
Eg: Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo
This is a meaningful sentence. "Buffalo" can be a city in new york, to baffle  someone, and american bisons.
- Even if a sentence is grammartically correct, it could still be not meaningful.
- Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo
- My translation: Baffled Buffalo buffalo baffling baffled Buffalo buffalo baffle baffled Buffalo buffalo.
### Speech acts
- If a verb names a speech act, it gotta pass the **thereby** test: Use your word to change the world
If I say, "I...," then I thereby... .
- It has to be said in right circumstances:
If I say, "I...," in appropriate circumstances, then I thereby... .
- Arguments are speech acts.
### Conversational acts
- To bring about a change in the world.
- The conversational act does not occur when the effect does not occur.
- The effect occurs at a later time, compared to a speech act's, which occurs at the time of utterance.
#### Conversational maxims
- By Paul Grice, to use when speakers are cooperating with each other.
- Quantity: Don't say more than what's required of you, but don't say too little the other person won't know what you're intended to convey
- Quality: Don't say what you don't believe in (aka don't lie) or what you have no justification for believing in.
- Relevance: be relavant.
- Manner:
	- be brief
	- be orderly
	- avoid obscurity
	- avoid ambiguity
- Just because the waiter says that you can only have cake or ice-cream, while prepares to serve his favorite customer pie, doesn't mean he's lying to you. He didn't say anything incorrect either, but certainly he's violating the conversational maxim of quantity by omitting relavant information.
- Conversation implication **is not** logical implication. When you don't like the premise of an argument because it violates the conversational maxim, you can't refute the argument based on that alone because the conclusion doesn't necessarily not follow from the premise.
