## The nature of argument
### Why arguments matter
- You want to have justified beliefs and reasons. Good arguments are a priori to good reasons.
- Learning objectives:
	* Analyze arguments.
	* Evaluate deductive arguments.
	* Evaluate inductive arguments.
	* Avoid fallacies.
### What is an argument
- Argument is not fighting. What you mean is a verbal fight, a yelling match, not an argument.
- Argument is not abuse, a personal attack.
An **argument** is:
- a series of sentences, statements, or propositions
- where some are premises
- and one is the conclusion
- where the premises are intended to give a reason for the conclusion
