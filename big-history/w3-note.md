# Threshold 5: Emergence of life
- Life is characterized by 3 things:
	- metabolism: organisms turning food into energy for self-serving.
	- reproduction: make copies of themselves.
	- adaptation: quality of species.
- Complexity: living things vs. nonliving things.
- Energy flow: associated with metabolism.
- Goldilocks conditions: chemical diversity on the early Earth, gentle energy flows (?, heat from the core and the sun), water, and the lack of oxygen.
## The origin of life
- 3.9B yrs ago, earth still got bombarded by asteroids.
- 3.8B yrs ago, volcanos spew out gases, creating the atmosphere consisting of mainly CO2, N2, NH3, CH4, water vapor, and no oxygen, because oxygen is reactive, which tends to make complex chemicals break out. Large molecules then accumulate in the oceans.
- Building blocks of life:
	- proteins: amino acids.
	- polysaccharides: sugars.
	- dna, rna: nucleic acids
		- dna which has a double helix shape with two complementary strands. If we took out a strand, it'd quickly degrade into two strands.
- The first microsphere (which could divide and accumulate materials) soaks up a rna molecule, which can do enzyme-like activities, aka metabolism.
- The last common universal ancester was the original cell from which all life have evolved from.
## Dating methods
- To know the ages of various entities on Earth. Isotope dating.
## Evolution
- Natural selection.
	- advantageous mutation.
- Replication.
### Paleontology - history of life on earth
- the intersection among biology, geology, and chemistry.
	- paleonbiology: contructs organisms like they once were.
	- paleonecology: groups of organisms.
	- stratigraphy: rocks.
- trace fossils (fossil record).
- fossil analysis.
