- Big history is the history of everything. 
## 4 big ideas:
1. Energy
2. Emergence
3. Goldilocks conditions
4. Thresholds
## Relationship between historical & scientific explanation
- Scientific: (controlled) experimentation and hypothesis testing and making prediction
- historical explanations shouldn't "just so" stories
## Testing claims:
- theories are subject to change, but is still useful to be used now because there's no better alternatives.
- Epistemilogy: questions about belief and knowledge. What are counted as knowledge.
- fallibillism: the view in epistemilogy that beliefs can be justified without being certain
- "Is justfied true belief knowledge?"
- Two unhelplful approaches for justified beliefs:
	+ requires certainty: leads to unhealthy skepticism
	+ requires coherence to current beliefs: leads to unhealthy relativism
- How to develop beliefs that are most likely to be true? Using epistemic tools (claims testers) (in order):
	1. intuition: gut feeling, background beliefs
	2. authority: you can't become everything!!!
	3. logic:
	4. evidence: all the three above use evidence
## How did our universe get more complex
### First three thresholds
1. the birth of the universe 13.8 billion years ago: 
	- the universe is still expanding.
	- the big bang theory could predict the flow of energy (cosmic background radiation) in the universe.
	- what's the goldilocks condition for the creation of the universe?
2. the appearance of the first stars:
	- gravity makes materials clump together => star formation => huge energy from fusion. so gravity's the goldilocks condition here.
3. the creation of a new chemical elements inside dying stars.
	- more complex chemically: > 90 elements.
	- energy flows: chemical energy
	- goldilocks conditions: gravity > pressure inside the star
	- emergence: diverse matters.
## Why do we need to care about this: Life, universe, and everything
- gives you a big picture so we can know where we are now when we need to.
- is a transformative exp.
- encourages transdisciplinarity: fusion of 'two cultures'.
- improves critical thinking.
- enables you to live a million lives.
