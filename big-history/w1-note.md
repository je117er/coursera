- Big history is the history of everything. 
## 4 big ideas:
1. Energy
2. Emergence
3. Goldilocks conditions
4. Thresholds
## Relationship between historical & scientific explanation
- Scientific: (controlled) experimentation and hypothesis testing and making prediction
- historical explanations shouldn't "just so" stories
## Testing claims:
- theories are subject to change, but is still useful to be used now because there's no better alternatives.
- Epistemilogy: questions about belief and knowledge. What are counted as knowledge.
- fallibillism: the view in epistemilogy that beliefs can be justified without being certain
- "Is justfied true belief knowledge?"
- Two unhelplful approaches for justified beliefs:
	+ requires certainty: leads to unhealthy skepticism
	+ requires coherence to current beliefs: leads to unhealthy relativism
- How to develop beliefs that are most likely to be true? Using epistemic tools (claims testers) (in order):
	1. intuition: gut feeling, background beliefs
	2. authority: you can't become everything!!!
	3. logic:
	4. evidence: all the three above use evidence
