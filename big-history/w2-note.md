# The Big Bang
## Observational evidence for the Big Bang
### Redshift
- All objects in the universe are receding from one another. Also called redshifting (receding means redder, recall doppler's effect)
- There's some point in the past where all objects were in the same point (Big Bang moment)
### Cosmic microwave background radiation
- Relic of the Big Bang
- Released 380,000 years ago after the Big Bang, remnants of the epoch of recommbination.
- You can see temperature fluctuations corresponding to later developments of different objects on the map of CMBR in the early universe.
#### Epoch of recombination
- Immediately after the Big Bang, most matters existed as plasma.
- 380,000 years after the big bang, the expanson was now great enough to allow ions to go near together to form the first stable, neutral atoms, namely hydrogen and heliium. This is called the epoch of recombination. Matter and radiation were separate (???).
- Current temp of universe is 3K, and it's 300K 380,000 years ago, which is also called the moment of decoupling - transition of ions to neutral atoms. Also Wien's law (relating wavelength and temp.)
## How do we know stars form
- Recall EM spectrum. Visible wavelength.
- Main sequence (stars are burning hydrogen).
- Population one stars: common in spiral galaxy (milky way). Young. Also called metal-rich stars. Metal just means their atmospheres including elements heavier than hydrogen.
- Population two stars: older stars, metal-poor.
### How stars really form.
- Giant metal clouds attracted to one another by gravitation => increasing density, temp, until the temp condition for fusion (!!!) is fulfilled. Voila our first star. This is called gravitation contraction.
- Now where does gravitation contraction come from? Stars dying fast (think 10s of million years) collapsed into themselves, the temp so high supernovae happened. The shock waves from these supernovae compress the residual gas and dust in the vicinity close together. Remember the age of sun calculation.
### First 3 stars
- Born 30M to 300M years after the Big Bang. Shined more brightly than any stars today.
## Where did elements come from
- Fusion and fission inside stars' cores, and supernovae.
## Threshold 4: The solar system
- Acretion: dust and gas orbiting youngc sun. gravitation turned them into planetesimal, then planets.
- Young sun blasted H and He far away => inner planets are more metal-y, while outer ones are gassy.
### Earth
- Young Earth was super hot with radioactive materials from supernovae and got bombarded by asteroids and meteorites. So hot it melted, then heavier elements like iron and nickel sank into the core, which created the magnetic field.
- Plate tectonics explains how the surface of the Earth formed and changed: Heat from the core warmed up rocks in the mantle => rocks move => crust moves. When will the core lose all of its potential energies, tho?
## Summary
- Flow of energy: gravitational energy helps forming stars, planets. Energy inside earth's core including pressure, radioactivity, plate tectonics.
- Goldilocks conditions: clouds of gas that has all elements in the periodic table (to create a planet).
- Emergence: so many complex chemicals formed.
## Why does this matter
- Because we're the universe. Oh my god. Now when all the big picture puzzles have fallen into place, it all makes sense now. Imagine the atoms in your right hand might come from different star than from your left hand. I just can't...
