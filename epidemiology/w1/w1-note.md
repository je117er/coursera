## Define epidemiology
### The study of
- The distribution of health outcomes or disease within populations. 
- Factors determining spread of health outcomes and diseases.
- It follows that epidemiology focuses on studying populations, rather than individuals.
### Epidemiologic transition
- Describes changing patterns of:
	- Age
	- Mortality
	- Fertility
	- Life expectancy
	- Causes of death
#### 4 major epidemiologic transitions since the agricultural period begins:
1. Hunter-gatherer to cities: Change from few epidemics to major epidemics. Infectious and nutritional diseases linked to agriculture and food production. Eg: zoonotic diseases, nutrient deficiencies (no more hunting/gathering), and increased contact with disease vectors during agricultural activities.
2. Human's immune systems and disease-causing organisms evolved in parallel, causing the change from major epidemics to endemic diseases. Eg: human developing physical/genetic changes.
3. Change to chronic and degenerative diseases, due to the respond to the increased level of nutrition, public health, clinical medicine, etc. Humans in this period had longer lifespan, and generally sedentary lifestyles.
4. Started at the end of the XX century, when new diseases mingled with reoccurence of infectious diseases, with the latter spread rapidly through globalization.

### Examples of research areas using epidemiology
- infectious disease epidemiology
- chronic disease epidemiology
- maternal and child health
- injury and accidents: developed since 1996. happened under certain patterns and conditions, therefore preventable.
- environmental epidemilogy:
- nutrition: diet, physical activity, food allergy
- health policy: should be evidence-based
- health bevior: substance abuse, psychiatric behavior

### Definitions:
#### Current day definition of epidemiology
- study of the distribution and determinants of disease and health outcomes in specified populations, and the application of this study to the control of health problems
#### Use in public health
- to develop, target, and evaluate prevention strategies:
	- primary: *before* the person gets the health outcome
	- secondary: *after* health outcome, but *before* symptoms
	- tertiary: *already* has symptoms of health outcome
- to evaluate intervention strategies:
	- individual: changing individual behavior or risk factors. eg: smoking is bad for your lungs
	- structural: promote health by altering structural context. eg: taxation of tobacco products
### Person, place, time and population perspective
#### Descriptive epidemiology
Characteristics of:
- Person
- Place
- Time
Describes frequency and distribution of disease or risk factors in populations
Used for:
- evaluate trends
- health status
- new diseases
- evaluate public health programs
- identify problems
#### Analytic epidemiology:
studies:
- risk factors
- preventive factors
uses:
- comparison groups
#### Two health perspective
1. Biomedical perspective focuses on:
	* agents causing disease.
	* their mechanisms
	* individual risk factors.
but doesn't include social/environmental factors.
2. Population perspective:
	* social factors
	* environmental factors
looks at:
1. proximal(downstream/micro level):
	* genetic makeup
	* age
	* ethnicity
	* gender
	* immune status
2. distal (upstream/macro level):
	* community design
	* education
	* employment
	* living/working conditions
	* poverty
3. underlying causes of health outcomes in populations:
	* environmental
	* economic
	* social
	* cultural
**Example: lung cancer**
- causes by carcinogens in cigarettes, mostly.
- social mechanism inducing smoking in the past:
	* status symbol
	* sign of leisure
	* media and movie stars
	* smoking at work
	* marketing to women (prior to which smoking had been seen as a masculine activity)
	* women's suffrage (more exposure at work)
**Example: diabetes**
- genetic
- physiological
- psychological
- familial
- social
- economic
- cultural
- political
