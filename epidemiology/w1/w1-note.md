# Learning objectives

## Define epidemiology
### The study of
- The distribution of health outcomes or disease within populations. 
- Factors determining spread of health outcomes and diseases.
- It follows that epidemiology focuses on studying populations, rather than individuals.
### Epidemiologic transition
- Describes changing patterns of:
	- Age
	- Mortality
	- Fertility
	- Life expectancy
	- Causes of death
#### 4 major epidemiologic transitions since the agricultural period begins:
1. Hunter-gatherer to cities: Change from few epidemics to major epidemics. Infectious and nutritional diseases linked to agriculture and food production. Eg: zoonotic diseases, nutrient deficiencies (no more hunting/gathering), and increased contact with disease vectors during agricultural activities.
2. Human's immune systems and disease-causing organisms evolved in parallel, causing the change from major epidemics to endemic diseases. Eg: human developing physical/genetic changes.
3. Change to chronic and degenerative diseases, due to the respond to the increased level of nutrition, public health, clinical medicine, etc. Humans in this period had longer lifespan, and generally sedentary lifestyles.
4. Started at the end of the XX century, when new diseases mingled with reoccurence of infectious diseases, with the latter spread rapidly through globalization.
## List the uses of epidemiology in public health

## Describe how epidemiology supports improving the public's health

## Characterize two perspectives on health outcomes in populations, the biomedical perspective and the population perspective
