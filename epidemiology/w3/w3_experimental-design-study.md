# Experimental study design
## Experimental vs. Non-experimental (observational) studies
- The basic difference is the exposure assignment.
- In experimental studies, test subjects will be assigned exposures randomly. For example, a study of whether bed nets reduce the risk of infants getting and dying malaria has receiving bed nets as the exposure.
- In observational studies, researchers don't assign exposures (interventions).
## Two types of experimental studies
### Based on exposure classification
#### Randomized control trial
- In a randomized control trial, for example, half a group will receive the experimental drug, the other half a placebo/current standard of care. Test subjects will be randomly assigned to each half of the group.
- Use: to test new drugs or medical treatments.
- The key is to have both the intervention and control groups be comparable in all aspects except for the intervention.
- Disadvantages:
	- external validity-generalizability (the groups in the study may not be generalizable to the population at large.)
	- narrow focus
	- costly
	- ethical considerations.
#### Clinical case crossover trial
- Subjects switch from one treatment to the other after a period of time.
- There's washout period between the two exposures to wait for the effect of the previous exposure to go away.
- Order of exposure is randomized.
- Shorter interventions are preferred to reduce the number of test subjects dropping out.
### Blinding
- Used to hide certain information from different groups of people in a study. A double blind study avoids both observer and interviewee bias.
- Types of blinding:
	- non-blinded.
	- single-blinded: subject or researcher blinded
	- double-blinded: both subject and researcher are blinded.
	- triple-blinded: subject, researcher and statistical analyst blinded.
### Based on number of test subjects
- Individual
- Community
- The unit of analysis for an individual/community is an individual/community, respectively.
## Observational studies:
### Cohort study design
- Follow a population over a period of time to see if they develop a health outcome of interest.
- A cohort is a group of persons sharing a common characteristic (e.g., geographic location, socioeconomic status, gender, etc.)
- Procedure:
	1. Baseline exposure: test subjects free of health outcome of interest.
	2. Follow them up over time
- Useful for rare exposures. 
- Use risks and rates to measure.
#### Cohort study example: British Physicians
- Cohort: male British physicians.
- Characterisitics: occupation, geographic location
- Exposure: smoking.
#### Open study population
- Participants can join at any point, within limitations.
- Measures person-time (rate) therefore is less prone to problems with sample size
#### Close study population
- Closed to **new** participants.
#### Retrospective study
- The cohort is formed in the past and ends today.
#### Prospective study
- The cohort is formed starting from now and followed into the future.
- Outcome of interest: mortality.
- From the source population (cohort), potential participants already have health outcome of interest will be eliminated (cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, etc).
- Both retrospective and prospective studies can also be called longitudina/follow-up studies.
### Advantages
- good for multiple outcomes.
- provides evidence of temporality between exposure and outcome: exposure clearly precedes the outcome.
### Disadvantages:
- expensive
- time-consuming
- resource-intensive
- inefficient for rare outcomes
- loss to follow-up
